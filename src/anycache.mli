(** {1:basics Basics} 

    This module defines a cache that can be used to speed up slow computations
    (typically involving network or disk I/O).
    When a computation finishes successfully its result is stored in the cache.
    If the computation fails only the key is cached, the value is recomputed
    assuming that errors are transitory.

    If you try to lookup a value in the cache while a computation is in progress
    (only possible if you are using Lwt or Async) then you get the result
    from the previous computation if it succeeds (and recomputed on failure).
    This ensures that you don't flood the disk/network with queries for the same
    key. Handling timeouts is the caller's responsibility though.

    If the computation is referentially transparent
    (always returns the same value when invoked with the same key) then
    {!Anycache.S.with_cache} should be used for caching.

    If the computation can return different values when called at
    different times, and this affects the semantics of your application
    (e.g. reading a file, performing an http query) then
    {!Anycache.S.with_validator} should be used.
    It allows to specify a validator that can determine whether the result is
    still valid, and recompute it if needed
    (e.g. by performing a conditional HTTP GET).
    
    The lookup times are worst case logarithmic in the size of the cache.
    This is needed to avoid the worst case linear lookup times of a hash table
    in case of collisions (the keys are assumed to be externally controllable,
    e.g. from a URL or form values).
    If this overhead is not acceptable or you just want to cache pure computations
    look at [Memo] (from [core_kernel]) or [CCCache] (from [containers])
    instead.

    A cache with string keys is provided by default, you can instantiate your
    own using {!Make}.

    {2:lrupolicy Cache replacement policy}

    When the cache's capacity is exceeded an old element is removed.
    The old element is determined such that we keep often accessed values in
    the cache, and that accessing a long sequence of elements once (a scan)
    doesn't completely remove all elements from the cache.

    Three queues are used: short-term ([A1in]),
    evicted short-term ([A1out]), and long-term ([Amain]).

    Elements start out in the short-term cache, and when its capacity is exceeded
    the element is moved to the evicted short-term queue (we preserve the data).
    If it is accessed again while on the evicted queue it is promoted to the
    long-term queue, otherwise when the evicted queue's capacity is exceeded
    it is dropped.
    Accessing elements while on the short-term queue has no effect,
    and it is managed like a FIFO queue.

    When the long-term queue's capacity is exceeded its Least Recently Used
    element is discarded.

    The short-term queue stores at most 25% of total capacity, and the long-term
    queue stores at most 50%.
    The evicted queue's size is dynamically adjusted to use all available space,
    i.e. when the long-term queue has few elements it will store more than 25%
    of the elements.
    This is done so that we always use the cache to its full capacity, even if
    the long-term elements are few.

(** {1:examples Examples}

Given a potentially slow function (DNS lookup):
{[
open Result
let lookup name =
  Printf.printf "Looking up %s\n" name;
  try Ok (Unix.getaddrinfo name "" [])
  with e -> Error e

let print_result = function
  | Ok lst -> Printf.printf "Got %d addresses\n" (List.length lst);
  | Error e -> raise e
]}

We can construct a cached version:

{[
let cache = Anycache.create 1024
let cached_lookup = Anycache.with_cache cache lookup

let () =
  print_result (cached_lookup "example.com");
  print_result (cached_lookup "example.com");
  print_result (cached_lookup "example.net");
]}

Running it produces:
{v
$ ocaml $(opam config var anycache:doc)/example.ml
Looking up example.com
Got 6 addresses
Got 6 addresses
Looking up example.net
Got 6 addresses
v}
*)
